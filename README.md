What will make your project at Kickstarter successful?

Status: Relaunch of project March 22nd 2019. This project is in progress!


## About this project
When I applyed to the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly I had to submit a case where I looked at data from Kickstarter. The task was to bring forward findings that made projects at Kickstarter successful. I only worked with MS Excel. (Since I did not have SQL at my privat computer when applied. I have worked with SQL for many years but the Microsoft SQL server management studio was on my work computer.)

Now after the program is done I thought that it would be interesting to look at the same thing using the same data set. To see if my first findings were correct and if my data analysis skills have developed. So that is what I'm doing in this project. 

I hope that you will find it interesting to see what kind of progress that is possible to do during just 12 weeks.


## Data
CSV-file provided by General Assembly

The data contained following 17 columns: 
* project id	
* name
* url	
* category	
* subcategory	
* location	
* status	
* goal	
* pledged	
* funded percentage	
* backers	
* funded date 
* levels	
* reward levels	
* updates	
* comments	
* duration

And nearly 46,000 rows.
